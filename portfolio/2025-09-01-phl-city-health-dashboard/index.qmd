## Context

### Project 

Philadelphia health disparities aren't connected to political geography, leaving council members without district-level insights for policy decisions.

This deliverable is an interactive dashboard visualizing health determinants across 10 council districts, making public health data actionable for policy makers and citizens.

## Technical Journey

### Phase 1: Tech Stack Design (March 2025)

- Data preservation infrastructure (Zenodo integration)
- Dashboard rapid prototyping with R Shiny (reuses Data Engineers code) but makes dynamic
- Dashboard production requirements: no cold starts so serverless SSG with highly modern UI and visualizations: Next.js SSG
- Production deployment given zero operating cost: GitHub Pages static site

### Phase 2: R Shiny Prototype (March-April 2025)

Rapid prototype for concept validation:

- Core interactions: dropdown selection, synchronized visualizations
- District highlighting and hover effects
- Stakeholder feedback integration

### Phase 3: Next.js Production (May-June 2025)

Production rebuild optimized for budget and operational constraints:

**Frontend Architecture:**

- Next.js/React.js with Highcharts.js
- Static site generation for cost-effective hosting

**Key Features:**

- Synchronized bar charts and choropleth maps
- Custom Heat Vulnerability Index visualization
- Interactive district selection with highlighting
- Embedded documentation and metadata

**Production Infrastructure:**

- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages static hosting (budget-optimized)
- **Data Preservation**: Zenodo integration for DOI/citation
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics tracking
- **SEO**: Search optimization for discoverability

### Technical Highlights

- Client-side rendering for serverless architecture
- Custom data pipeline from R to web-ready formats
- Production deployment designed for minimal operational overhead

## Impact

Transforms Philadelphia health data into actionable policy insights through accessible, district-organized visualizations.
